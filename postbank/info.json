    "DESCRIPTION" : "PostBank is a banking system for Discord servers that want an automated way of enforcing people to engague in a creative community. It discourages shilling by requireing them to give feedback and engague in the community in a positive way before allowing them to post. This prevents new members on large discord servers from popping in and dropping a link to their soundcloud, never to engauge further in the community. Server admins have privledges to change account balances and manage users from within Discord.",
